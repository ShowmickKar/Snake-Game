# A Simple Snake game made in python and pygame

I made a snake game using python and used algorithmic technique to efficienty control the snakes movement and resize/grow it's body.

Prerequisites: You need to have pygame installed on you computer to run/test the game. To install pygame, open up your terminal(or Command Prompt if you are on Windows) and type:

```
    pip install pygame
```
